# Taxi-fare-prediction
In this competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, one is tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model. The challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!

In this repository, you will find a notebook containing an attempt that utilizes LightGBM to obtain an RMSE score of **3.21**.
